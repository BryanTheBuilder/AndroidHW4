Write a program that allows a user to simulate an edit history that would be used while writing a document. Your program should keep an edit history of 10 items.  There are several commands that the user should be able to input and that the program should store. The user should be able to input a string, “copy”, “delete”, “undo” and “quit”. 

When a user inputs a string that string should be saved into the edit history. 
When they copy the last string stored in the edit history should be re-entered into the history. When they delete the last string should be removed. 
When they undo the last string removed should be added back into the history again. 
And when they quit the program should terminate.
